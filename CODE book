In order to achieve the tidy data set, the follwing steps were taken:
1) Data was downloaded according to each data type (train or test) considering each variable inependently.
2) Descriptive names were assigned to the new dta set in order to make the data more easily readable and accessible. 
3) The data sets loaded were then merged into one large data file using a common variable name: subject.
4) Means and Standard deviations were then calculated for each easurnment of the merged data set.
5) A new tidy data set was created where the mean function was applied to each variable of each of the measurnments tested.
6) Finally, the tidy data set file was converted into a text file.
